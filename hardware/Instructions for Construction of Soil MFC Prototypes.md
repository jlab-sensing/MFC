# Instructions for Construction of Soil MFC Prototypes

## _June 2022_

### Jack Baskin Engineering, The University of California, Santa Cruz

This document is an instruction manual on how to re-create the soil microbial
fuel cells constructed by Colleen Josephson's laboratory at The University of
California, Santa Cruz. Please note, this document is an instruction on the
physical construction of the fuel cells only. Code and circuit documentation can
be found elsewhere in the git repository. This document will provide
instructions on how to construct one bin containing two MFCs which can be
connected in series or parallel.

###### Required Materials

- Large Plastic Bin *get dimensions*
- Soil
- Dechlorinated water
- Burlap
- Carbon Felt
- Wire
- Clips
- TEROS 12 Soil Moisture Sensor

### 1.

Sift the soil chosen for construction of the MFC. Sift debris from the soil such
as large rocks or plant material, for construction of a single unit there should
be approximately 9.5-11 litres of sifted soil. Add water and stir the soil till
the soil reaches the consistency of mud.

Insert the burlap into the plastic bin. The burlap should reach the bottom of
the bin and all corners. Clip the burlap to the edges of the plastic bin. See
figure 3 for an example. It is recommended to use at least three layers of
burlap to prevent tearing.

### 3.
Cut out four 12.5cm diameter carbon felt circles.

### 4.

Cut an appropriately long piece of wiring to insert into a carbon felt circle.
The exact length can vary, but the wiring should be at least 30cm to ensure
that the wire can exit the soi. Strip 12.5cm inches of wiring bare, and insert
the wire parallel to the large flat faces of the carbon felt circle. It is
acceptable if some of the wire sticks out of the carbon felt, but enough should
be in contact with the felt to ensure strong conductivity.

Repeat this process for all four carbon felt circles.

### 5.

Pour approxiamtly 3cm-5cm of mud into the burlap. Make sure the mud is
distrubeted evenly, and that there are no air bubbles. Lay two of the carbon
felt circles flat on the mud at opposite ends of the bin. Each carbon felt
circle will serve as an anode of one microbial fuel cell.

### 6.

Pour an additional 2cm of of mud on top of the anodes. Be sure to pour the mud
evenly and avoid air bubbles.

Insert the TEROS 12 Soil Moisture Sensor slightly adjacent to where the carbon
felt circles would be. Lay the sensor horizontal with the three tips pointing
towards the MFCs. Ensure that the cord of the sensor does not lead out above the
anodes.

### 7.

Pour another 3cm layer of mud on top of the carbon felt layer. For a total mud
layer between the anodes and the cathodes of 5cm. Once again make sure the mud
pours flat and that there are no air bubbles. Lay the second set of carbon felt
circles directly over top where the cathode carbon felt circles are 5cm below.
This second set of carbon felt circles serve as the cathodes, and if the
cathodes are too far offset from the anodes the MFC will not produce any
voltage.

### 8. 

Monitor and maintain desired soil moisture over time.
