# Instructions for Construction of Soil MFC Prototypes
## _June 2022_
### Jack Baskin Engineering, The University of California, Santa Cruz
This document is an instruction manual on how to re-create the soil microbial fuel cells constructed by Colleen Josephson's labratory at The University of California, Santa Cruz. Please note, this document is an instruction on the physical construction of the fuel cells only. Code and circuit documentation can be found elsewhere in the git repository. This document will provide instructions on how to construct one bin containing two MFCs which can be connected in series or parralel.
###### Required Materials
- Large Plastic Bin *get dimensions*
- Soil
- Unchlorintated water
- Burlap
- Carbon Felt
- Wire
- Clips
- TEROS 12 Soil Moisture Sensor

### 1.
Sift the soil chosen for construction of the MFC. Sift debree from the soil such as large rocks or plant material, for construction of a single unit there should be approximatlye 9.5-11 litres of sifted soil. Add water and stir the soil till the soil reaches the consistency of mud.

Insert the burlap into the plastic bin. The burlap should reach the bottem of the bin and all corners. Clip the burlap to the edges of the plastic bin. See figure 3 for an example.

### 3.
Cut out four 12.5cm diameter carbon felt circles.

### 4.
Cut an appropiatly long piece of wireing to insert into a carbon felt circle. The exact length can vary, but the wireing should be at least 30cm to ensure that the wire can exit the soi. Strip 12.5cm inches of wireing bare, and insert the wire parallel to the large flat faces of the carbon felt circle. It is acceptable if some of the wire sticks out of the carbon felt, but enough should be in contact with the felt to ensure strong conductivity.

Repeat this process for all four carbon felt circles.

### 5.
Pour approxiamtly 2cm of mud into the burlap. Make sure the mud is distrubeted evenly, and that there are no air bubbles. Lay two of the carbon felt circles flat on the mud at oppisate ends of the bin. Each carbon felt circle will serve as an anode of one microbial fuel cell.

### 6.
Insert the TEROS 12 Soil Moisture Sensor with the three points down inbetween the two cathodes. The three points reaching the bottom of the plastic.

### 7.
Pour a 5cm layer of mud on top of the carbon felt layer. Once again make sure the mud pours flat and that there are no air bubbles. Lay the second set of carbon felt circles directly over top where the cathode carbon felt circles are 5cm below. This second set of carbon felt circles serve as the cathodes, and if the cathodes are too far offset from the anodes the MFC will not produce any voltage.

### 8.
Pour an additional 2cm of mud overtop the cathode layer.
