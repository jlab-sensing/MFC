### serial_stream.c

Daemon to collect TEROS measurements from Arduino and log them to a file. 

Build instructions:
1.) gcc teroslogger.c -o teroslogger #compile...should probably just change name to teroslogger.c instead of renaming it
2.) mv teroslogger /bin #move executable to bin
3.) chown/chgrp root teroslogger #make root the owner
4.) chmod u+s /bin/teroslogger #set suid bit to make the daemon runnable

Test by running `teroslogger -t /dev/tty<ARDUINOUSB>`, it should create a log file with sensor readings.
NOTE: for regular operation, it is recommended to use the soil_battery service to start logging upon boot instead of starting the teroslogger process by hand

### soil_battery.service

systemd service file, allows us to start power and TEROS logging upon boot. 

### soil_battery_start.sh and soil_battery_stop.sh

these are the scripts that soil_battery.service hooks into. Currently specialized for rocketloggers, but would be easy to adapt for Shepherd.
